          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>In October of 2021, the city of Hartford installed traffic-calming speed humps on Flatbush Avenue in an attempt to reduce the number of crashes that were frequently occurring on the street. This research was conducted to see the effectiveness of the speed humps and whether or  not more should be installed on other busy streets in Hartford. These traffic-calming humps were also installed on other major streets surrounding Trinity College, including Summit Street, Allen Place, and Wethersfield Avenue. Weâ€™ve chosen to analyze the speed humps on Flatbush Avenue due to the fact that they were installed the earliest, and therefore have the most data available. The city of Hartford hoped that by introducing these speed humps, drivers would slow down and drive more cautiously. With Trinity being located in such a busy area, the safety and well-being of the students was also another push for installation of the humps, especially after the tragic death of a fellow student in March of 2022. Last March, a young girl and her two friends were struck by a fast-moving car on New Britain Avenue. Following the crash, the city also installed white bollards on New Britain Ave in an attempt to reduce the high number of crashes that had been occuring. Currently, there is data prior to the installation and for up to 17 months post installation, and the results are extremely helpful to the city of Hartford. Because the city of Hartford wants what is best for its people, it is important to ask the question, did crashes change after traffic-calming speed humps were installed on Flatbush Ave? We will be analyzing this data from two different date ranges: 12 months pre and post speed hump installation, and 17 months pre and post speed hump installation in order to examine the immediate and long-term effects of these traffic-calming measures.</p>

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future DataViz students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, such as <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/'>CT EdSight</a>, and also link to your shared Google Sheets.</p>

          <h2>Sources</h2>
          <p>In order to create our data story regarding the speed humps on Flatbush Avenue, we utilized many online sources and tools. First, we used <a href="https://www.placemark.io"> Placemark.io</a> (CREC) to help us create the corridor that will determine which points/crashes to include in our data and eventually in our chart. Then, to collect data for our charts we used the UCONN Crash Data Repository to find all crash data in Hartford for 1 year before and after the speed humps were installed as well as for 18 months before and after the speed humps were installed. Finally, we are using Map Shaper to import our corridor and our crash data all in one place so that we can visualize it. The last sources are our shared google sheet that contains data of the crashes that we obtained from the UCONN Crash Data Repository. There are two sheets: the first contains data and a data analysis of 12 months pre and 12 months post installation and the second contains data and a data analysis of 17 months pre and 17 months post installation.

        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
